## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely Delivery ensures that the project is completed on schedule and within budget. When projects are delivered on time, it reduces the chances of cost overruns, schedule delays, and other risks associated with the project. 
 Project Managers can ensure that deadlines are met by Creating a work breakdown structure and estimating the time correctly by Breaking down the project into smaller tasks and Identifying the most critical tasks of the project allowing Prioritizing tasks and understanding dependencies. This brings about clarifying roles and responsibilities to team members minimizing confusion and improving accountability for efficient project execution
To keep the project on schedule, Track the progress to identify issues before they escalate. There should be a well-defined Plan for risks and create a mitigation plan. For any unforeseen change, there should be a formal request for change in scope and management of stakeholder expectations

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control enables organizations to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and budgeting, ensuring that projects remain within budgetary constraints while maximizing return on investment.
Creating a budget for the project at the start of the planning session. During the project's life cycle, you'll need this budget to cover your expenses and payments.
 Keeping Track of Expenses assists in keeping tabs on a project's budget as it progresses through its various stages
Proper Time Management to complete the project on schedule. The project manager must regularly remind the workforce of its essential timelines.
Change Control in a Project A change control system is needed to account for any potential modifications in the project. Each modification to the project scope impacts deliverable timelines, which means that alterations may increase project costs by increasing the amount of effort required

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is a flexible form of project management where it allows for changes to be done as the project is ongoing, its iterative and incremental approach is ideal for projects that can be implemented in phases. Unlike Agile, waterfall approach follows the design from the inception it follows a linear flow of process making it a rigid approach

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
For projects that are to be implemented in phases Agile would be Ideal this allows users to interact with the project and critic it and give feedback allowing for changes to be done. A good example is a website, Users can be able to interact with the sites and give feedback which can be easily implemented to meet the needs raised.
Waterfall is Ideal for projects that are permanent and there is no room for improvement after execution on the same project. Once done it goes as is. Example is construction of a building, once the plan is approved and project started it is difficult to go in with modification of the same. Waterfall is cost effective since the project is likely to follow the budget it was allocated.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Process checklist and a project audit determine if a project is on track to deliver services. 
Automated Code Review Tools to checks source code for compliance with a set of rules or best practices
A quality management plan with a well-defined set of documents and knowledge that allows quality throughout a product development project, from planning through deployment
Quality Control Peer reviews and testing ensures that the requisite quality of the deliverables is met also it is important to monitor the quality of the deliverables to alter them if they do not meet up the established requirements.
It is important to maintain high standards to keep the integrity of the product or service throughout its development.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope is a part of the project planning process that documents specific goals, deliverables, features, and budgets.  The scope document details the list of activities for the successful completion of the project. The scope is defined by understanding the project requirements and the client's expectations
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a visual, hierarchical and deliverable-oriented deconstruction of a project

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Project Scheduling allows prioritization, tracking, resource allocation, Risk management, and stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project.
A Gantt chart give the visual representation of the project schedule, showing the start and finish date of several elements of a project defining all the expected timelines

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Mashinani Merry –go –round system aims at tracking Membership Application, shares contribution, dividends calculation, membership withdrawal process, and flagging risky group members in the rural settlement.
People is rural settlement have been in ages running informal financial assistance groups without the knowledge of incorporating software’s to help them manage their group data. The informal way of recording has led to many groups loosing accountability of their contributions and tracking their lending activities. Thus leading to collapsing of groups due to bad lending practices. 
This software is aimed at making the lending activities traceable and accounted for by all members
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Defining the problem allows one to know who is their target audience, how the solution will be interacted with by the end user, which resources one would be outsourcing and at what cost. What would be the product immersion process? Trainings and documentation to be involved among others

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Mashinani Merry-go-round is a group lending management service that allows members to register, track contributions and manage lending activities in the rural area settlement.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Membership application Process- this allows members to collect member details which is ideal for tracking, Membership fee contribution is easy to track. 
Shares contribution- Members contributions are documented and with this will determine the lending limit for members.
Lending Process- Loans applied by members tracking the repayment and interest calculations,
 Dividends Calculations- computation of dividend at the end of a financial year
 Membership Withdrawal process-track who has left the group 
 Risky Member Marking- tracking members who default payments regularly for lending purposes

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Voting registration data for my area is readily available in public domain, using that I can determine the market side especially using the gender ratio of the area. 
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
By understanding needs, preferences, and challenges faced by a group of people one is able to get an idea of what is on demand
